# hello-world
Only right to go through the traditions... My beginnings with git.

I am an ambitious, quick-learning and creative problem solver looking to make a difference to people by tackling challenging problems. My ambition is to design and develop technology that benefits society and I see an opportunity to bring my unique analysis, coding and optimisation experience crafted in Formula 1 to an exciting company.
